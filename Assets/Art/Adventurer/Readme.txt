Adventurer 3D model by José Díaz (dogzerx@hotmail.com)

Package contains:
*Fully rigged 3D adventurer model.
*23 animations.
*Sword and shield.

Comence your adventuring in 3D game developing with this fully animated character! It has been rigged with character studio so animations should work well with other characters rigged the sort of skeleton.
With your purchase you're free to use this character in your free or commercial game. Credits are not neccesary but they'd be highly apreciated! 

If you have requests, critique or comments on this package, feel free to mail me at "dogzerx@hotmail.com"
